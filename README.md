# FPGA_Scope
In SMD-soldering there are a lot of very tiny parts with even smaller solder pads. If you really want to solder these parts, you need some sort of magnification. Commonly, a digital microscope is used here. The goal of this repo is to build something like this with an inexpensive FPGA-DevKit - specifically the CYC 1000 from Trenz Electronics

## Hardware
As stated, the main Chip/DevKit is the Cyclone 10 LP from Altera on the CYC1000.
In addition to this there is the daugtherboard that connects the camera to the FPGA aswell as an HDMI-port.

## Software
